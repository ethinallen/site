# Personal Site
Since I know all three and a half of you are really passionate about my life and what I've been up to: here's my personal site.

### It's broken at least 40% of the time because I push to master :)

- This is a fun project of mine that I thought of while in Seattle. You can look up a profile by username on Github and it will turn their most recent commit messages into ~tweets~ geets.
- I would be remiss to not warn that if, for whatever reason, you are on mobile, that page is going to look janky as hell. This is by design.. or the lack thereof. I'm new to react okay give me some more time and maybe it will be somewhat mobile friendly.
