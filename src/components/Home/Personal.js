        Outside of work, I love Formula 1, Golf, language learning, and
        adventures. If Iâ€™m not coding you can likely find me driving
        somewhere in my tiny van. I want to see as much of the world as possible
         and hear the stories of as many people as possible. I like to go on
         long drives across the country and talk with my friends along the way.
         I love podcasts and learning strange facts.
