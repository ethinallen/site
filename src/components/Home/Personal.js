          Outside of work, I love Formula 1, Golf, language learning, and
          adventures. If I’m not coding you can likely find me driving
          somewhere in my tiny van. I want to see as much of the world as possible
           and hear the stories of as many people as possible. I like to go on
           long drives across the country and talk with my friends along the way.
           I love podcasts and learning strange facts.
